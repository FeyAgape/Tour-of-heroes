# TourOfHeroes

The Tour of Heroes follows the Tour of Heores Angualar official tutotial which uses the fundamentals of Angular.

The app helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. This basic app has many of the features you'd expect to find in a data-driven application. It acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.

It uses the fundamentals of Angualr such as:

1. Uses built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.
2. Creates Angular components to display hero details and show an array of heroes.
3. Uses one-way data binding for read-only data.
4. Adds editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
5. Binds component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
6. Enables users to select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view.
7. Formats data with pipes.
8. Creates a shared service to assemble the heroes.
9. Uses routing to navigate among different views and their components.
